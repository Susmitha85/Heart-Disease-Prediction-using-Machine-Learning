# üíì Heart Disease Prediction with Machine Learning

## üß† Introduction

This project leverages **machine learning algorithms** to predict the presence of heart disease using patient clinical data. Developed in **Python** using **Google Colab**, this tool applies various classification models and evaluates their performance. It also integrates an interactive **Gradio** web interface for users to input health parameters and receive instant prediction results.

> *‚ÄúGiven clinical parameters about a patient, can we predict whether or not they have heart disease?‚Äù*

## üöÄ Features

* ü©∫ Predict heart disease based on medical attributes (e.g., age, blood pressure, cholesterol).
* üß™ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with plots and correlations.
* üìä Model training using:

  * Logistic Regression
  * K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  * Random Forest
* üîç Hyperparameter tuning using:

  * RandomizedSearchCV
  * GridSearchCV
* ‚úÖ Model evaluation with metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score, and Confusion Matrix.
* üìà Feature importance visualization.
* üåê Interactive **Gradio-based UI** for real-time prediction.
* üéØ Accuracy achieved over **95%** with Logistic Regression.

## üõ† Installation Instructions

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: This project is built and run on **Google Colab**, no local environment setup is required.

To run this project:

1. Open the notebook on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1hUd4l5nCQeTRgwo-qSDPJtDfIFFPNzmJ).
2. Upload the dataset (`heart.csv`) to your Colab environment.
3. Run each cell in order to:

   * Load data
   * Explore and visualize
   * Train ML models
   * Tune hyperparameters
   * Launch Gradio UI

### Required Libraries:

```bash
pip install gradio
pip install scikit-learn
pip install pandas
pip install seaborn
```

These will already be installed in most Colab environments.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Usage Guidelines

1. **Model Training**:

   * The models are trained on the Cleveland heart disease dataset.
   * Logistic Regression is used as the final tuned model for prediction.

2. **Prediction Interface**:

   * At the end of the notebook, a `Gradio` interface will launch in your browser.
   * Input parameters like age, sex, chest pain type, cholesterol, etc.
   * The system will return a message like:

     * ‚úÖ "YOU HAVE NO DISEASE"
     * ‚ùó "YOU HAVE DISEASE"

3. **Output Example**:

   ```
   Age: 58
   Sex: 1
   Cholesterol: 240
   Max Heart Rate: 160
   ...
   ‚û§ Result: YOU HAVE NO DISEASE
   ```
